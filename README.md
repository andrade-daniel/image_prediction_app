# Predicting a car view/frame with Deep Learning

Here you can find:

- A simple app (I really recommend the streamlit package) where you can paste a image url of a car and see the prediction of the view (from 'Frontal', 'Frontal right', 'Frontal left', 'Lateral', 'Rear right', 'Rear left', 'Rear').
- Code that you can use to train your own Deep Learning model that will be loaded in the app.

### Pre-requisites

Having Python 3 installed.

### Installing

At the command prompt:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Getting Started

Check the folders.

Enjoy!


### TODO:
- update code from keras to tf.keras
